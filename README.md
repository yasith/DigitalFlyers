##Digital Flyers
####Android app made for the Waterloo Facebook Hackathon 2014. 

The goal of the app is to be a modern grocery flyer. No one likes to read the paper flyers anymore, they're just real world spam.

This app lets you browse the deals in your local grocery stores, just like you shop on Amazon.com

####Technologies used
1. [Parse](http://parse.com) for automatically updating our GridView with new deals.
2. [ActiveAndroid](http://www.activeandroid.com/) for storing data in SQLite database, without pulling our hair out.
3. [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) for downloading images, caching them and processing them, again without too much hair loss.
